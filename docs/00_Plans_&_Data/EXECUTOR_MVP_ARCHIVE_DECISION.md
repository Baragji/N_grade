# Executor MVP → Archive Decision

**Date:** October 1, 2025  
**Decision Authority:** Steve Jobs Principle ("Build it right, not retrofit it")  
**Status:** ✅ Executed

---

## 🎯 Decision

**Archive executor-mvp prototype, build production system from clean foundation.**

### Location
```
/executor-mvp → /.archive/executor-mvp_20251001
```

---

## 🧠 Rationale

### Problem
Two conflicting roadmaps:
- **Executor-MVP Roadmap:** Phase 0→3 (prototype scope)
- **Production Roadmap:** Phase 0→8 (autonomous AI coding system)

Trying to integrate creates:
- ❌ Architectural confusion ("which Phase 0?")
- ❌ Technical debt from day 1 (retrofitting foundation around prototype)
- ❌ Unclear ownership and code quality standards

### Steve Jobs Test
> "The prototype proved the concept works. Good. Now we know what we're building. Don't bolt a production system onto a prototype—that's how you get a mess. Archive it, learn from it, and build the real thing right."

### Production Excellence Principles
1. **Prototypes ≠ Production** — Different quality bars, different purposes
2. **Clean Foundations** — Phase 0 should be purpose-built, not retrofitted
3. **Single Source of Truth** — One roadmap, one architecture, one vision
4. **Zero Technical Debt** — Start clean, stay clean

## ✅ What We Learned (Preserved)

The MVP proved these patterns work:

| Pattern | Implementation | Status for Production |
|---------|---------------|----------------------|
| **JSON Schema Validation** | Ajv validator | ✅ Reuse in Phase 1 |
| **Path Sandboxing** | No `../`, whitelist dirs | ✅ Critical security, reuse |
| **Pluggable LLM Providers** | OpenAI/Anthropic switch | ✅ Good abstraction |
| **`_executor_meta.json`** | Per-execution metadata | ✅ Traceability pattern |
| **Web UI for Browsing** | Static file browser | ✅ Rebuild in Phase 3 |

## 📦 Archive Contents

**Preserved at:** `/.archive/executor-mvp_20251001/`

**Key Files:**
- `src/executor/systemPrompt.md` — Original system prompt design
- `contracts/executor-output.schema.json` — JSON schema (reference for Phase 1)
- `src/llm/providers/` — LLM abstraction layer
- `docs/mvp_delivery_notes.md` — Original delivery documentation
- `ROADMAP.md` — MVP roadmap (Phase 0-3)

---

## 🚀 Impact on Phase 0 Build

### Before This Decision
Phase 0 instructions included:
- "Preserve executor-mvp as-is"
- "Build around existing code"
- "Plan integration for Phase 1"

### After This Decision
Phase 0 instructions remain unchanged:
- ✅ **Clean slate** — Build canonical structure from scratch
- ✅ **No integration debt** — No "work around MVP" compromises
- ✅ **Single roadmap** — Phase 0→8, no confusion
- ✅ **Reference available** — Archive exists for pattern reference

## 📋 Phase 1 Integration Plan

When rebuilding Executor in Phase 1 (Core Architecture):

1. **Reference archived code** for patterns (don't copy-paste)
2. **Reuse JSON schemas** (validate and update to production spec)
3. **Improve path sandboxing** (add chroot, namespace isolation)
4. **Integrate with canonical state management** (not standalone `./output/`)
5. **Add comprehensive tests** (TDD from day 1)

## 🎓 Lessons for Future Phases

1. **Prototypes prove concepts** — They're meant to be discarded after learning
2. **Clean foundations win** — Retrofitting is technical debt
3. **Single vision matters** — Conflicting roadmaps create confusion
4. **Archive, don't delete** — Preserve learning, discard implementation
5. **Steve Jobs was right** — Focus and simplicity require hard choices
