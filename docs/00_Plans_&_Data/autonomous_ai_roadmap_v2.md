## Phase 0: Foundation Setup (Week 1–2)
The foundation phase ensures the codebase, infrastructure tooling, and governance scaffolding exist before any autonomous agent logic lands. The objective is to reduce setup friction for subsequent phases, while capturing every decision in reproducible evidence artifacts. Engineering, security, and finance stakeholders collaborate to define success metrics, cost envelopes, and compliance guardrails that will persist throughout the programme.

### 0.0 Strategic Kick-off and Charter Approval
Establishing a charter prevents thrash later in the project, particularly when multiple specialist teams will need to coordinate sequencing. The kickoff must document the problem statement, success criteria, funding limits, and primary risks in a charter stored under `docs/strategy/charter.md`. Stakeholders sign off using a short approval workflow captured in `evidence/approvals/phase0_charter.json`.

The kickoff meeting includes architecture, DevOps, compliance, product, and finance partners. Each discipline commits to staffing levels, availability, and review cadence. The session also produces a stakeholder RACI table, clarifying accountability for each later gate.

The output of this subsection becomes the north star for gating decisions: if the initiative veers from the charter, the roadmap requires re-baselining before Phase 2 begins.

1. Charter development steps: Gather prior research, risk registers, and business cases from `docs/strategy/inputs/`.; Document scope boundaries, non-functional requirements, budget ceilings (€250k for six months), and regulatory obligations (EU AI Act GPAI compliance).; Review charter with legal and finance to obtain written approval..
2. Stakeholder alignment steps: Produce RACI matrix and store as `docs/strategy/raci_phase0.csv`.; Schedule recurring steering committee meeting (weekly, 45 minutes) with agenda stored in `docs/strategy/steering_agenda.md`..

```yaml
# docs/strategy/charter.yaml
initiative: autonomous_ai_coding_system
mission: >-
  Deliver a production-grade autonomous coding platform with verifiable safety,
  security, and compliance controls within 26 weeks.
budget_eur: 250000
stakeholders:
  - role: Architecture Lead
    contact: mira.koo@example.com
  - role: Security Officer
    contact: sven.larsen@example.com
steering_cadence_days: 7
success_metrics:
  - name: charter_signoff
    target: true
    evidence: evidence/approvals/phase0_charter.json
```

Success criteria:
- Charter signed by architecture, compliance, finance, and product within 5 working days (verified in `evidence/approvals/phase0_charter.json`).
- Stakeholder RACI matrix lists at least 10 roles with unique owners (checked in `docs/strategy/raci_phase0.csv`).
- Steering committee cadence scheduled for the full 26-week timeline (calendar export stored in `evidence/approvals/steering_schedule.ics`).

Evidence Required:
- `docs/strategy/charter.md`
- `docs/strategy/charter.yaml`
- `docs/strategy/raci_phase0.csv`
- `evidence/approvals/phase0_charter.json`

Validation Process:
1. Review charter markdown and YAML for completeness and ensure alignment with budget and scope constraints.
2. Confirm signatures or digital approvals exist for all required stakeholders in `phase0_charter.json`.
3. Verify the RACI CSV contains each gate owner and no duplicate assignees.
4. Present the charter to the steering committee and record minutes in `docs/strategy/steering_minutes/2025-Week01.md`.

### 0.1 Repository and Branch Protection Baseline
A deterministic repository structure prevents later integration pain. This subsection codifies the tree layout, environment configuration, and branch policies necessary for G0 sign-off. The actual creation steps must be scripted to avoid manual drift between environments.

The repository must immediately include canonical directories so automated tooling (dedupe, index, gate validation) functions from day one. Branch protection ensures all future merges satisfy CI requirements.

1. Repository bootstrap steps: Use `scripts/bootstrap_repo.py` to generate skeleton directories with `.keep` files.; Initialize git hooks using `scripts/install_hooks.sh` to enforce linting before commits.; Commit initial state with signed tags and record hash in `evidence/gates/g0_foundation.json`..
2. Branch protection configuration steps: Enable status checks `ci`, `security`, `sbom` on `main` via GitHub API script.; Require signed commits, linear history, and minimum two reviews.; Export policy settings to `evidence/release/branch_protection.md`..

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# scripts/bootstrap_repo.sh
set -euo pipefail
mkdir -p src/{agents,orchestration,models,tools,api}
mkdir -p tests/{unit,integration,e2e}
mkdir -p docs/{architecture,api,guides,ops,compliance}
mkdir -p evidence/{gates,static_checks,secrets_scan,release}
mkdir -p metrics/{kpi,cost,quality,errors,usage,performance}
mkdir -p sbom recovery logs/ai_actions siem/parsers governance/technical_file
find src tests docs evidence metrics sbom recovery logs siem governance -type d -empty -exec touch {}/.keep \;
```

Success criteria:
- Repository contains all required directories with `.keep` markers (validated via `scripts/validate_structure.py`, output stored in `evidence/gates/g0_foundation.json`).
- Branch protection policy includes at least four status checks and requires signed commits (verified via GitHub API snapshot in `evidence/release/branch_protection.md`).
- Initial commit hash recorded and tagged `v0.0-foundation` (tag metadata stored in `evidence/gates/g0_foundation.json`).

Evidence Required:
- `evidence/gates/g0_foundation.json`
- `evidence/release/branch_protection.md`
- `scripts/bootstrap_repo.sh`

Validation Process:
1. Run `scripts/bootstrap_repo.sh` and inspect git status to ensure clean tree.
2. Execute `scripts/validate_structure.py --strict` and archive report under `evidence/gates/g0_foundation.json`.
3. Query GitHub branch protection API and confirm JSON matches required settings.
4. Perform peer review of bootstrap commit and capture approval in `evidence/approvals/bootstrap_review.json`.

### 0.2 Development Environment Provisioning
A reproducible development environment ensures every engineer and automation agent operates with identical toolchains. The environment must support Python, Node.js, Docker, and Meilisearch/Qdrant services used by the documentation knowledge base.

Detailed provisioning ensures the environment runs on macOS and Linux with parity. Token management and secrets loading must use `.env` files stored outside version control, with hashed checksums recorded for audit.

1. Container orchestration steps: Define `docker-compose.yml` with services `app`, `postgres`, `redis`, `meilisearch`, and `qdrant`.; Configure health checks ensuring start-up within 45 seconds and restart policies of three attempts.; Map volumes for persistent Postgres and Qdrant data directories under `.infra_data/`..
2. Developer tooling steps: Use `scripts/install_dev_tools.sh` to install `uv`, `npm`, `pre-commit`, `awscli`, and database clients.; Provide `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` for VS Code Remote Containers usage.; Document environment variables in `docs/ops/environment_reference.md` including encryption guidance..

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml (excerpt)
version: "3.9"
services:
  app:
    build: .
    command: uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
    environment:
      ENVIRONMENT: development
      DATABASE_URL: postgresql+psycopg2://app_user:strongPass!@postgres:5432/autonomous_ai
      REDIS_URL: redis://redis:6379/0
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    depends_on:
      postgres:
        condition: service_healthy
      redis:
        condition: service_healthy
  postgres:
    image: postgres:17-alpine
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: autonomous_ai
      POSTGRES_USER: app_user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: strongPass!
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U app_user -d autonomous_ai"]
      interval: 5s
      timeout: 3s
      retries: 10
```

Success criteria:
- `docker compose up` completes within 60 seconds and health checks report `healthy` (captured via `docker compose ps` output in `evidence/gates/g0_foundation.json`).
- `scripts/install_dev_tools.sh` completes with exit code 0 on macOS 14 and Ubuntu 22.04 (logs stored in `evidence/gates/g0_foundation.json`).
- Secrets are loaded from `.env` with SHA-256 hash recorded in `evidence/security/env_hashes.json` without exposing actual values.

Evidence Required:
- `docker-compose.yml`
- `scripts/install_dev_tools.sh`
- `docs/ops/environment_reference.md`
- `evidence/security/env_hashes.json`

Validation Process:
1. Run `docker compose up -d` and `docker compose ps` to confirm statuses.
2. Execute `scripts/install_dev_tools.sh --verify` and store logs under `evidence/gates/g0_foundation.json`.
3. Validate `.env` hash file exists and matches the `SHA256` command output.
4. Perform peer review of environment docs; capture comments in `docs/ops/environment_reference_review.md`.

### 0.3 CI/CD Pipeline Foundation
The CI/CD foundation enforces linting, testing, security scans, and SBOM generation from day one. The pipeline runs on GitHub Actions with job fan-out for performance and passes artifacts downstream to gating scripts.

The pipeline must execute within 12 minutes for baseline repositories and fail fast on linting issues. Cost telemetry is captured per run for FinOps tracking.

1. Workflow authoring steps: Split pipeline into `lint`, `test`, `security`, and `sbom` jobs using a shared setup composite action.; Cache dependencies using `actions/cache` for pip, npm, and uv caches to keep runtime <12 minutes.; Upload artifacts to `artifacts/ci/{run_id}/` to enable audit..
2. Secrets management steps: Store API keys in GitHub Actions secrets with environment-specific restrictions.; Configure OIDC trust relationships for cloud providers to avoid long-lived credentials.; Document rotation cadence in `docs/ops/secret_rotation.md`..

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml (excerpt)
name: Autonomous AI CI
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, release/*]
  pull_request:
    paths-ignore:
      - docs/**
      - '*.md'

```

Success criteria:
- Pipeline runtime ≤ 12 minutes at p95 (recorded in `metrics/kpi/ci_duration.csv`).
- All jobs upload artifacts and coverage report stored in `coverage/coverage.xml` with coverage ≥ 75% baseline (evidence in `evidence/gates/g2_quality_system.json`).
- SBOM job publishes `sbom/SBOM.json` each run and attaches to workflow summary.

Evidence Required:
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- `.github/actions/setup-python-and-node/action.yml`
- `metrics/kpi/ci_duration.csv`
- `evidence/gates/g0_foundation.json`

Validation Process:
1. Trigger CI pipeline on bootstrap branch and inspect results.
2. Confirm coverage artifact is uploaded and parse to validate threshold.
3. Download SBOM artifact and verify CycloneDX schema compliance using `scripts/validate_sbom.py`.
4. Store validation summary in `evidence/gates/g0_foundation.json`.

### 0.4 Release Controls and Merge Governance
Robust release controls prevent destabilizing merges during rapid iteration. This subsection enforces merge queues, automated backouts, and release metadata capture.

1. Merge governance steps: Enable GitHub merge queue with batch size 1 to guarantee deterministic builds.; Configure required reviewers for security and QA roles.; Introduce `scripts/check_release_window.py` to block merges outside approved calendar windows..
2. Release automation steps: Implement action `.github/workflows/release.yml` generating signed tags and release notes.; Integrate auto-revert workflow triggered by failing post-merge checks.; Store release metadata in `evidence/release/merge_history.jsonl`..

```python
# scripts/check_release_window.py
import json
from datetime import datetime
from pathlib import Path

WINDOW_FILE = Path("docs/ops/release_windows.json")
now = datetime.utcnow()
windows = json.loads(WINDOW_FILE.read_text())
if not any(window["start"] <= now.isoformat() <= window["end"] for window in windows):
    raise SystemExit("Releases are blocked outside approved windows; update docs/ops/release_windows.json")
```

Success criteria:
- Merge queue enforces single-entry batches with queue size metrics stored in `metrics/kpi/merge_queue.csv`.
- Auto-revert completes within 180 seconds when post-merge checks fail (logged in `evidence/release/auto_revert.log`).
- Release notes generated for each merged PR with commit SHA references (captured in `docs/ops/release_notes/`).

Evidence Required:
- `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- `docs/ops/release_windows.json`
- `metrics/kpi/merge_queue.csv`
- `evidence/release/merge_history.jsonl`

Validation Process:
1. Simulate merge using dry-run branch and confirm queue gating works.
2. Trigger manual failure in staging pipeline to validate auto-revert.
3. Review release notes for accuracy and completeness.
4. Update `evidence/gates/g0_foundation.json` with validation outcomes.

### 0.5 Error Contract and Observability Instruments
Consistent error semantics simplify debugging and ensure clients receive actionable information. The project adopts RFC 7807 Problem Details across APIs and internal agent interactions.

1. Contract authoring steps: Define schema `docs/api/error_contract.md` with enumerated error codes, remediation links, and trace correlation expectation (`X-Trace-Id`).; Implement middleware that maps exceptions to RFC 7807 payloads.; Provide JSON Schema for validation stored at `docs/api/error_contract.schema.json`..
2. Observability instrumentation steps: Enrich FastAPI responses with trace IDs propagated from LangGraph context.; Aggregate error metrics in Prometheus with dashboards saved under `docs/ops/dashboards/error_budget.yaml`..

```python
# src/api/middleware/error_handler.py
from fastapi import Request
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from .errors import ProblemDetail

async def problem_details_middleware(request: Request, call_next):
    try:
        response = await call_next(request)
        return response
    except ProblemDetail as detail:
        payload = detail.to_dict()
        payload["trace_id"] = request.headers.get("X-Trace-Id", "unknown")
        return JSONResponse(status_code=detail.status, content=payload)
```

Success criteria:
- 100% of API errors conform to RFC 7807 schema (validated via contract tests `tests/contracts/test_errors.py`).
- Error rate dashboards show < 1% 5xx responses per day (metrics in `metrics/errors/api_error_rate.csv`).
- Every error log contains trace ID and correlation to LangGraph session (checked by `scripts/audit_error_traces.py`).

Evidence Required:
- `docs/api/error_contract.md`
- `docs/api/error_contract.schema.json`
- `tests/contracts/test_errors.py`
- `metrics/errors/api_error_rate.csv`

Validation Process:
1. Run contract tests and store junit output under `reports/tests/contract_errors.xml`.
2. Execute synthetic load test generating controlled errors and confirm RFC 7807 payload.
3. Review dashboards for baseline error budget compliance.
4. Document validation summary in `evidence/gates/g1_architecture.json`.

### 0.6 Build-vs-Buy Decision Engine
An explicit Build-vs-Buy framework protects the team from ad-hoc tooling choices and ensures vendor evaluations remain consistent across phases. The engine operates as a repeatable workflow producing three artifacts per decision: comparison matrix, decision record, and RACI alignment.

1. Workflow steps: Populate `research/ComparativeMatrix.csv` with scoring dimensions (licensing, latency, GDPR posture, customization capability).; Generate `research/DecisionRecord.json` capturing weighted scores, recommendation, and fallback.; Update `research/RACI.md` to assign ownership for the chosen path..
2. Automation steps: Use `scripts/run_bvb_evaluation.py` to fetch benchmark data, cost estimates, and compliance notes.; Store resulting attachments in `evidence/strategy/build_vs_buy/*.json` for audit..

```json
{
  "decision_id": "bvb-llm-orchestrator-2025Q1",
  "options": [
    {"name": "LangGraph", "score": 8.6, "notes": "Strong policy control"},
    {"name": "Custom FSM", "score": 6.2, "notes": "Higher engineering lift"}
  ],
  "final_choice": "LangGraph",
  "approved": true,
  "approved_by": ["architecture_lead", "security_officer"],
  "evidence": ["research/ComparativeMatrix.csv", "research/DecisionRecord.json"]
}
```

Success criteria:
- Each tooling decision includes ≥ 4 evaluation criteria with quantified scores (validated by `scripts/run_bvb_evaluation.py` into `evidence/strategy/build_vs_buy/report.json`).
- Final decision approved by architecture and security leads within 72 hours of submission.
- RACI document updated with owner and backup for each selected capability.

2. Trigger CI pipeline and archive results under `metrics/kpi/ci_duration.csv`.
3. Review Build-vs-Buy decision artifacts with architecture board and capture decision minutes.
4. Run `python scripts/validate_gates.py --gate G0 --strict` and ensure zero missing evidence paths.

## Phase 1: Core Architecture (Week 3–6)
Phase 1 converts the foundational repository into a production-ready architectural skeleton capable of orchestrating multi-agent workflows. The focus is on deterministic state management, resilient orchestration, strict budget enforcement, and compliance-aware data routing. Every subsystem introduced in this phase is measured against precise latency, durability, and availability targets so that later autonomy features build on trustworthy rails.

### 1.0 Distributed State Fabric
The distributed state fabric combines Redis for low-latency caching with PostgreSQL for durable storage. The solution must guarantee zero session loss while offering sub-100 ms retrieval times for hot reads. The design also introduces hashed integrity checks so forensic tooling can detect tampering during recovery drills.

#### Technical Requirements — Distributed State Fabric
- ≤ 50 ms round-trip latency for Redis GET operations at p95 (monitored via `metrics/performance/state_cache_latency.csv`).
- ≤ 120 ms for PostgreSQL write commitments with synchronous replication enabled (logged in `metrics/performance/state_write_latency.csv`).
- Hash integrity validation covering 100% of stored session documents (`evidence/gates/g1_architecture.json`).

#### Integration Points — Distributed State Fabric
- Redis cluster configured with TLS termination using certificates stored in `security/certs/redis/`.
- SQLAlchemy engine re-used by quality validation service to avoid duplicate connection pooling logic.
- MDC layer (Phase 3) reads from the same normalized tables to avoid dual-write inconsistencies.

1. Implementation sequence: Provision Redis and PostgreSQL using Terraform modules stored under `infra/terraform/state/` with remote state in secure S3 bucket.; Create Alembic migrations generating tables `sessions`, `state_audit`, and `state_hash_index`.; Implement repository classes `src/state/repository.py` with atomic operations combining cache and database writes..
2. Observability sequence: Instrument Prometheus exporters on both Redis and PostgreSQL; store dashboards under `docs/ops/dashboards/state_fabric.json`.; Enable `pg_stat_statements` to monitor long-running queries and log to `metrics/performance/postgres_statements.csv`.; Configure alerts for cache hit ratio < 92% or replication delay > 3 seconds..

```python
# src/state/repository.py
from __future__ import annotations
import hashlib
import json
from dataclasses import dataclass
from datetime import datetime
from typing import Any, Dict

from redis import Redis
from sqlalchemy import text
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session

@dataclass
class StateRepository:
    redis_client: Redis
    db_session: Session
    ttl_seconds: int = 3600

    def save(self, session_id: str, payload: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:
        """Persist state with integrity hash and TTL enforcement."""
        serialized = json.dumps(payload, sort_keys=True)
        state_hash = hashlib.sha256(serialized.encode()).hexdigest()
        self.redis_client.setex(f"session:{session_id}", self.ttl_seconds, serialized)
        self.db_session.execute(
            text(
                """
                INSERT INTO sessions(id, payload, payload_hash, updated_at)
                VALUES (:id, :payload, :payload_hash, :updated_at)
                ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE SET payload = EXCLUDED.payload,
                payload_hash = EXCLUDED.payload_hash,
                updated_at = EXCLUDED.updated_at
                """
            ),
            {
                "id": session_id,
                "payload": serialized,
                "payload_hash": state_hash,
                "updated_at": datetime.utcnow(),
            },
        )
        self.db_session.commit()
        return state_hash
```

Success criteria:

#### Integration Points — Session Ledger
- Writes occur via orchestration layer events to avoid direct agent coupling.
- Quality assurance agents reference ledger for regression triage.
- Compliance export pipelines stream ledger data to secure data lake for audit.

1. Ledger pipeline steps: Implement Kafka topic `session.ledger` with exactly-once semantics.; Use Debezium connectors to mirror PostgreSQL ledger tables to analytics store.; Provide replay service `src/state/ledger_replay.py` controlling deterministic rehydration..
2. Audit tooling steps: Build `scripts/audit_ledger.py` comparing sequential hashes across partitions.; Schedule weekly verification via GitHub Actions workflow `ledger-audit.yml`.; Alert security if checksum mismatch occurs using PagerDuty integration..

```python
# src/state/ledger_replay.py
from typing import Iterable
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from models import LedgerEvent

def replay_events(session: Session, event_ids: Iterable[int]) -> None:
    """Replay ledger events in strict order with idempotency safeguards."""
    for event_id in sorted(event_ids):
        event = session.get(LedgerEvent, event_id)
        if event is None:
            raise ValueError(f"Ledger event {event_id} missing")
        if event.replayed:
            continue

## Phase 2: Quality Assurance System (Week 7–10)
Phase 2 transforms the architecture into a rigorously validated platform. Automated validation pipelines, benchmark suites, and go/no-go automation ensure every change meets repeatable quality bars before entering protected branches. The goal is to reach Gate G3 with evidence showing tests, coverage, and benchmarking are deterministic and transparent.

### 2.0 Professional Validation Pipeline
A consolidated validation pipeline runs static analysis, security scans, type checks, and automated tests with artifact publication. The pipeline is modular so teams can extend it without regressing runtime targets.

Overview: The validation orchestrator loads rule configurations, sequences tool execution, aggregates results into JSON payloads, and publishes composite scores. This provides a single gate for CI and local development.

1. Execution steps: Configure `src/quality/validation_runner.py` to call Ruff, Mypy, Bandit, Semgrep, Pytest, and npm test suites.; Aggregate outputs into `evidence/gates/g2_quality_system.json` with tool versions and pass/fail status.; Upload JUnit XML and coverage reports to `reports/tests/` for integration into dashboards..
2. Performance safeguards: Use caching for dependencies to maintain total runtime ≤ 15 minutes.; Run CPU-intensive analyses in parallel using `pytest -n auto` and asynchronous subprocess control.; Fail fast when any critical severity issue appears..

```python
# src/quality/validation_runner.py
import asyncio
from quality.runners import ruff_runner, mypy_runner, bandit_runner, semgrep_runner, pytest_runner

async def run_all():
    results = await asyncio.gather(
        ruff_runner.run(),
        mypy_runner.run(),
        bandit_runner.run(),
        semgrep_runner.run(),
        pytest_runner.run(),
    )
    return {result.tool: result.summary for result in results}
```

Success criteria:

```python
# src/context/mdc_ingestor.py
from typing import Dict
from uuid import uuid4

def ingest_document(doc: Dict[str, str]) -> Dict[str, str]:
    """Normalize document metadata into MDC schema."""
    normalized = {
        "id": str(uuid4()),
        "title": doc["title"],
        "tags": doc.get("tags", []),
        "source_path": doc["path"],
        "hash": doc["sha256"],
    }
    return normalized
```

- Use ArgoCD rollback to previous deployment revision.
- Drain traffic using blue/green service endpoints.

### 6.1 Observability and SLO Governance
Comprehensive observability ensures SLO compliance across latency, availability, and error rates.

1. Instrumentation steps: Collect metrics via Prometheus and logs via Loki.; Configure traces with OpenTelemetry exporting to Tempo.; Define SLOs in `docs/ops/slo_catalog.md` with targets (e.g., availability ≥ 99.9%)..
2. Monitoring steps: Build dashboards `docs/ops/dashboards/production_overview.json`.; Configure alert rules hitting PagerDuty and Slack when error budget burn rate > 2% per hour.; Store SLO evaluations in `metrics/quality/slo_compliance.csv`..

```yaml
# docs/ops/slo_catalog.md (excerpt)
- name: request_latency_p95
  target_ms: 250
  measurement: metrics/performance/service_latency.csv
  error_budget_percent: 1
```

Success criteria:
- Error budget burn rate ≤ 1% per hour over 30-day window.
- Alert acknowledgement within 10 minutes.
- Dashboards reviewed weekly by SRE and product teams.

| SLO Metric | Target | Measurement Window | Evidence |
|------------|--------|--------------------|----------|
| Availability | ≥99.9% | 30 days | `metrics/quality/slo_compliance.csv` |
| Latency p95 | <250ms | 7 days | `metrics/performance/service_latency.csv` |
| Error budget burn | ≤1%/hour | 24 hours | `metrics/quality/slo_compliance.csv` |

Evidence Required:
- `docs/ops/slo_catalog.md`
- `docs/ops/dashboards/production_overview.json`
- `metrics/quality/slo_compliance.csv`

Validation Process:
1. Simulate traffic bursts and observe SLO tracking.
2. Verify alerts reach on-call team promptly.
3. Archive weekly dashboard snapshots in `_reports/dashboards/production/`.

Rollback Procedure:
- If observability stack fails, revert to previous configuration stored in `deploy/observability/history/`.
- Use manual scripts to collect critical metrics during outage.

### 6.2 SIEM and Audit Readiness
Structured logging and SIEM integration provide audit trails for AI actions and system events.

1. Logging steps: Emit JSON logs with correlation IDs to `logs/ai_actions/*.jsonl`.; Parse logs using SIEM connectors defined in `siem/parsers/*.conf`.; Enforce retention policy documented in `siem/retention_policy.md`..
2. Audit steps: Run monthly audit report generator `scripts/generate_audit_report.py` summarizing actions.; Store outputs in `_reports/audit_summaries/{month}.json`.; Notify compliance upon completion..

```python
# scripts/generate_audit_report.py
import json
from pathlib import Path

records = []
for log_file in Path("logs/ai_actions").glob("*.jsonl"):
    with log_file.open() as handle:
        for line in handle:
            records.append(json.loads(line))
Path("_reports/audit_summaries/latest.json").write_text(json.dumps(records[-1000:], indent=2))
```

Success criteria:
- 100% of AI actions logged with correlation IDs.
- Audit report generated monthly with zero parsing errors.
- SIEM query latency ≤ 5 seconds for 24-hour window.

Evidence Required:
- `logs/ai_actions/*.jsonl`
- `siem/parsers/*.conf`
- `siem/retention_policy.md`
- `_reports/audit_summaries/*`

Validation Process:
1. Review SIEM dashboards for completeness.
2. Run audit generator and inspect output.
3. Confirm retention policy enforced by storage lifecycle rules.

Rollback Procedure:
- Pause log ingestion while investigating parsing issues.
- Restore previous parser configuration.

### 6.3 FinOps Operations and Cost Reporting
Operational FinOps ensures production costs remain predictable.

1. Reporting steps: Collect cloud spend and LLM usage into `metrics/cost/production_spend.csv`.; Publish weekly reports to finance via `scripts/export_finops_report.py`.; Track anomaly alerts in `metrics/cost/anomaly_events.csv`..
2. Optimization steps: Implement auto-scaling rules tied to metrics.; Use spot instances for non-critical workloads with fallback strategy.; Document rightsizing adjustments in `docs/ops/finops_adjustments.md`..

```bash
python scripts/export_finops_report.py \
  --source metrics/cost/production_spend.csv \
  --output reports/finops/weekly_{week}.pdf
```

## Phase 7: Scaling and Cross-Learning (Week 27–30)
Phase 7 extends the platform across multiple teams while preserving privacy, cost visibility, and regulatory readiness. The goal is to reuse insights safely and operate multi-tenant environments with clear accountability.

### 7.0 Cross-Project Learning Exchange
Cross-project learning converts anonymised performance signals into actionable recommendations without leaking sensitive data. Differential privacy budgets are enforced and opt-in governance ensures only willing teams participate.
- Aggregate metrics from opt-in projects, strip identifiers, and store signed summaries under `state/transfer/{project}/summary.json`.
- Generate recommendations in `state/transfer/recommendations/{date}.json` and route every suggestion through human review captured in `docs/ops/cross_project_review.md`.
Success criteria:
- Privacy budget ε ≤ 2 for all published insights; 0 privacy incidents recorded; recommendation acceptance ≥ 60% (tracked in `metrics/quality/cross_project_effectiveness.csv`).
Evidence Required:
- `state/transfer/**`
- `docs/ops/cross_project_opt_in.csv`
- `metrics/quality/cross_project_effectiveness.csv`
Validation Process:
- Review anonymisation job outputs with privacy leads.
- Spot-check recommendations against raw data.
