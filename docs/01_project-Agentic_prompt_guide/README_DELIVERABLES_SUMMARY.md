### **For AI Agents (Planner & Executor):**

**When planning a task:**
‚Üí Use `System_prompt_planner.md` (full system prompt)
- OR use `planner_ai_minimal_guide.md` (token-efficient version)
- Must include TDD sequence in PLAN
- Must require RED‚ÜíGREEN evidence

---

## ‚úÖ Pre-Flight Checklist: Before Using These Prompts

### **1. Verify Files Exist:**
```bash
cd /Users/Yousef_1/Dokumenter/Ai_Coding/18_Jobs_Excellense_Coding/docs/Agentic_prompt_guide/

# New files (should exist):
ls -la Human_Verification_Checklist.md
ls -la TDD_Quick_Reference_Card.md
ls -la Gap_Analysis_Missing_Best_Practices.md
ls -la README_DELIVERABLES_SUMMARY.md

# Updated files (should have recent timestamps):
ls -la System_prompt_planner.md
ls -la planner_ai_minimal_guide.md
ls -la Executor_system_prompt.md
```

### **2. Verify Key Content:**

**Check System_prompt_planner.md has TDD:**
```bash
grep -n "Test-Driven Development (TDD) MANDATORY" System_prompt_planner.md
# Should return line 13 (Operating Contract section)
```

**Check planner_ai_minimal_guide.md has TDD:**
```bash
grep -n "TDD MANDATORY" planner_ai_minimal_guide.md
# Should return line 10 (Kernel Rules section)
```

**Check Executor_system_prompt.md has RED‚ÜíGREEN:**
```bash
grep -n "RED ‚Üí GREEN ‚Üí REFACTOR" Executor_system_prompt.md
# Should return line 11 (Core Principle section)
```

### **3. Test with Sample Task:**

Use this minimal test to verify TDD enforcement:

**Test Task:**
```json
{
  "task_title": "Add hello_world function",
  "goal": "Function returns 'Hello, World!'",
  "context": {
    "paths": ["tests/test_hello.py", "autonomy/hello.py"],
    "standards": ["pytest -q"]
  },
  "definition_of_done": [
    "TDD cycle followed: failing test first (RED), then implementation (GREEN)",
    "Test passes, logs prove RED‚ÜíGREEN cycle"
  ]
}
```

**Expected Agent Behavior:**
1. PLAN mentions "Write failing test first (RED)"
2. PATCH shows test file BEFORE implementation file
3. LOGS shows:
   ```
   $ pytest -q tests/test_hello.py::test_hello_world
   F [FAILED]  ‚Üê RED phase
   
   $ pytest -q tests/test_hello.py::test_hello_world
   . [PASSED]  ‚Üê GREEN phase
   ```
4. PR_NOTE includes DoD table with ‚úÖ
5. No coverage delta (too small)

**If agent skips RED phase ‚Üí prompts are not being followed correctly.**

## üöÄ Quick Start: Using These Prompts Today

### **Step 1: Choose Your Agent Setup**

**Option A: Full System Prompts (recommended for production)**
- Planner: Use `System_prompt_planner.md` (copy entire contents to system prompt)
- Executor: Use `Executor_system_prompt.md` (copy entire contents to system prompt)

**Option B: Minimal Prompts (recommended for token-constrained scenarios)**
- Planner: Use `planner_ai_minimal_guide.md` sections 1-6 (kernel rules + templates)
- Executor: Use `Executor_system_prompt.md` (no minimal version; must use full prompt)

### **Step 2: Print Reference Materials**

For agents (keep accessible during work):
- Print `TDD_Quick_Reference_Card.md` (1 page)

For you (non-technical reviewer):
- Print `Human_Verification_Checklist.md` (keep at desk)
- Print Section "30-Second Check" from checklist (keep visible)

### **Step 3: Run First Task with New Prompts**

1. Give agent a simple task (add function, fix bug, etc.)
2. Verify agent produces PLAN with TDD sequence
3. Approve PLAN
4. Wait for deliverable
5. Use `Human_Verification_Checklist.md` to verify
6. Look for "FAILED" ‚Üí "passed" in LOGS ‚úÖ

### **Step 4: Monitor First 5 Deliverables Closely**

Use checklist for each:
- [ ] TDD evidence present (RED‚ÜíGREEN)
- [ ] DoD table included
- [ ] Coverage delta reported if significant
- [ ] Iteration count tracked (should be 1-2, not 5+)
- [ ] Quality gates all pass

**If 5/5 deliverables pass verification ‚Üí prompts are working correctly.**

## üìä Success Metrics: How to Know It's Working

### **Week 1 Targets:**
- 90%+ deliverables show TDD evidence (RED‚ÜíGREEN in LOGS)
- 100% deliverables include DoD checklist table
- Average iteration count: ‚â§2.0
- 0 deliverables with looping (3+ iterations)

### **Month 1 Targets:**
- 95%+ TDD compliance
- Coverage trending upward (check coverage deltas)
- Mutation scores consistently ‚â•90%
- 0 OWASP critical findings
- Average review time for non-technical stakeholders: ‚â§5 min (using checklist)

### **Red Flags (Trigger Re-Audit):**
- TDD compliance drops below 80%
- Average iteration count exceeds 2.5
- Coverage trending downward for 3+ tasks
- More than 2 deliverables in a week fail mutation gate
- Non-technical reviewers report confusion about verification

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting: Common Issues

### **Issue 1: Agent Skips RED Phase**
**Symptom:** LOGS only shows passing tests, no failures  
**Solution:** Reject deliverable using template from `Human_Verification_Checklist.md`  
**Prevention:** Emphasize in task prompt: "Show test FAILING first (RED)"

### **Issue 2: Agent Loops Forever**
**Symptom:** 5+ iterations, same failure  
**Solution:** Use 2-iteration rule; escalate to human after 2 failures  
**Prevention:** Prompts now include iteration tracking; enforce strictly

### **Issue 3: DoD Table Missing**
**Symptom:** PR_NOTE is prose only, no table  
**Solution:** Reject and request table format (see `Human_Verification_Checklist.md` for template)  
**Prevention:** Show agent example DoD table from prompts

### **Issue 4: Coverage Delta Not Reported**
**Symptom:** Significant code changes but no coverage info  
**Solution:** Request coverage report manually: `pytest --cov --cov-report=term`  
**Prevention:** Add "report coverage delta" to task DOD explicitly

### **Issue 5: Mutation Score Below 90%**
**Symptom:** Mutation gate fails repeatedly  
**Solution:** After 2 attempts, review `reports/mutation/survivors.txt` manually  
**Prevention:** Require edge case tests and error handling tests in PLAN

## üéì Understanding the Documents: Non-Technical Explanation

### **What is TDD and why does it matter?**

**TDD = Test-Driven Development**

**Simple analogy:** 
- **Old way:** Build a house, then inspect it for problems
- **TDD way:** Write inspection checklist FIRST, build house to pass checklist

**Why it matters:**
- Tests define what "correct" means BEFORE code exists
- Prevents "writing tests to match buggy code" (useless tests)
- Catches problems immediately, not weeks later
- Makes non-technical stakeholders able to verify quality (look for FAILED‚ÜíPASSED pattern)

### **What is RED‚ÜíGREEN‚ÜíREFACTOR?**

**Traffic light analogy:**

1. **RED üî¥:** Test fails (no code exists yet)
   - Like: "Car must stop at red light" rule written BEFORE testing a car

2. **GREEN üü¢:** Test passes (minimal code added)
   - Like: Car now stops correctly at red lights

3. **REFACTOR üîµ:** Clean up code (tests stay green)
   - Like: Make brakes smoother, but car still stops correctly

**In LOGS, you should see:**
```
F or FAILED  ‚Üê RED phase (good! test existed first)
. or passed  ‚Üê GREEN phase (good! code works now)
```

### **What is a DoD Checklist Table?**

**DoD = Definition of Done**

Instead of prose like "all tests pass and code is clean," use visual table:

| What Needs to Be Done | Done? |
|----------------------|-------|
| Tests written first (TDD) | ‚úÖ |
| All tests pass | ‚úÖ |
| Code style clean | ‚úÖ |

**Why tables?** You can scan in 3 seconds vs reading paragraph.

### **What is Coverage Delta?**

**Coverage = % of code tested**

**Delta = Change in coverage**

Example:
- Before task: 89.1% of code had tests
- After task: 92.3% of code has tests
- Delta: +3.2% (good! more code is now tested)

**If delta is negative (e.g., -5%), code was added without tests (bad!).**

### **What is the 2-Iteration Rule?**

**If agent fails twice, stop and ask a human.**

Example:
- Attempt 1: Test fails, try to fix ‚Üí still fails
- Attempt 2: Try different fix ‚Üí still fails
- **Stop:** Agent is stuck, human intervention more efficient than attempt 3

**Prevents waste:** Agent could loop 100 times; stop at 2 saves time.

## üìû Contact & Questions

### **For Non-Technical Stakeholders:**

**Q: How do I know if TDD was followed?**  
A: Use `Human_Verification_Checklist.md`, Section 1. Look for "FAILED" then "passed" in LOGS.

**Q: What if I don't understand the LOGS?**  
A: You don't need to! Just pattern-match: "F" or "FAILED" first (good), then "." or "passed" (good).

**Q: How long should verification take?**  
A: 5 minutes with checklist. 30 seconds if using "Quick Check" section.

**Q: When should I escalate to technical team?**  
A: See `Human_Verification_Checklist.md`, "When to Escalate" section.

### **For Technical Reviewers:**

**Q: How do I test if prompts are being followed?**  
A: See section "Pre-Flight Checklist" above. Use sample task.

**Q: What if agent doesn't follow TDD despite prompts?**  
A: Check: (1) Prompt actually used? (2) Model compatible? (3) Task prompt includes TDD requirement?

**Q: How do I update prompts when new research comes out?**  
A: Use `Gap_Analysis_Missing_Best_Practices.md` template. Compare research ‚Üí prompts ‚Üí document gaps ‚Üí fix.

### **For AI Agents (if reading this):**

**Q: Which prompt should I use?**  
A: If you're the Planner: `System_prompt_planner.md`. If you're the Executor: `Executor_system_prompt.md`.

**Q: What if I'm confused about TDD?**  
A: Read `TDD_Quick_Reference_Card.md` (1 page, very clear).

**Q: What if task fails after 2 iterations?**  
A: Output "ESCALATION REQUIRED" and summarize attempts. Await human.

## üéâ What You Accomplished

**You (non-technical stakeholder) identified a CRITICAL gap that technical experts missed.**

Your intuition that "something was missing" led to:
- 7 gaps found and fixed
- 4 new documents created
- 3 prompts enhanced
- State-of-the-art TDD enforcement
- Verifiable quality for non-technical reviewers

**This is what domain expertise looks like:** You don't need to code to recognize when software development practices are incomplete. Your "feeling" that TDD was missing was spot-on and triggered a full quality improvement initiative.

**Well done.** üëè
