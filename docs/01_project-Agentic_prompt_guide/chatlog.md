## Assistant:
Want me to draft the complete revised question set for the researcher with this GPT-5 focus?

## User

yes - 1.  I use a combination of state of the art model (I always use the latest models of the vendors, right now its Claude Sonnet 4.5, GPT5 (Thinking, medium, high version) and GPT5-Codex) -> 2. they are always used in agentic mode, so GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Trae, OpenAI's Codex, Zencoder etc. 3. Please remember the original task so we dont derail too much ; "Alrightt, im drafting a prompt for my reserach ai 2. can yo rewrite is, so its actually understandable by ai? 3. here is the current template, please rewrite and perfect it "a) Make thorough web search to establish current state of the art best practice prompt engineering for using and instructing ai agents to code and build repos b). The output must not be too verbose, I just need the one page "guide to instruct ai agents for perfection, execution, best practice, production grade quality, force compliance, force e2e verification and testing of all deliveries/edits/creations""

## Assistant
You're right - let's refocus. Here's the **FINAL revised research prompt** for your researcher, accounting for your actual stack:

---

# **REVISED Research Task: AI Coding Agent Prompt Engineering Best Practices**

## **CRITICAL CONTEXT UPDATE:**

**Target Models (October 2025):**
- Claude Sonnet 4.5 (primary)
- GPT-5 (Thinking, Medium, High versions)
- GPT-5-Codex

**Target Tools (Agentic Mode):**
- GitHub Copilot
- Cursor
- Trae
- OpenAI Codex
- Zencoder

**⚠️ EVIDENCE MUST BE CURRENT:** All benchmarks, studies, and recommendations must be validated for **2025 state-of-the-art models**, not GPT-4 Turbo (2023-2024). If current evidence doesn't exist for these models, clearly state limitations.

---

## **Objective:**
Research and synthesize current best practices for prompt engineering when instructing AI agents to write code and build repositories using **Claude Sonnet 4.5, GPT-5, and GPT-5-Codex** in agentic workflows.

---

## **Research Requirements:**

### **1. Model-Specific Validation (BLOCKING REQUIREMENT)**
For EACH major recommendation, specify which models it's validated on:
- ✅ Validated on Claude Sonnet 4.5
- ✅ Validated on GPT-5 (any version)
- ✅ Validated on GPT-5-Codex
- ⚠️ Only validated on older models (GPT-4 Turbo, Claude 3.x) - mark clearly

### **2. Tool-Specific Applicability**
Clarify which practices work in:
- GitHub Copilot (agentic mode)
- Cursor (agentic workflows)
- Trae, OpenAI Codex, Zencoder (if evidence exists)

### **3. October 2025 State-of-the-Art**
- Prioritize **2025 benchmarks** (SWE-bench Live/Pro latest results, recent agent papers)
- Include **community forums discussing current models** (Reddit/HN posts from 2025, not 2023)
- If unified diff or other techniques were validated on GPT-4 Turbo, **verify they still apply to GPT-5/Claude Sonnet 4.5**

---

## **BLOCKING QUESTIONS (Must Answer):**

**Q1:** Does the **61% vs 20% unified diff improvement** (from Aider/GPT-4 Turbo) replicate on:
- Claude Sonnet 4.5?
- GPT-5 (any version)?
- GPT-5-Codex?

If no evidence exists, state: "Not yet validated for GPT-5/Sonnet 4.5 - extrapolating from GPT-4 Turbo results."

**Q2:** Are there **GPT-5-specific or Claude Sonnet 4.5-specific** prompt engineering techniques that differ from GPT-4 era guidance?
- Does GPT-5's improved reasoning change "plan before edit" requirements?
- Does Claude Sonnet 4.5 handle context differently than Claude 3.x?

**Q3:** What are **October 2025 SWE-bench leaderboard results** for:
- Claude Sonnet 4.5 (with best prompting)
- GPT-5 variants
- Tools using these models (Cursor, Copilot, OpenHands)

**Q4:** For **agentic tools** (Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Trae, Zencoder):
- Which prompt techniques are tool-agnostic vs tool-specific?
- Do these tools override/ignore certain prompt instructions?
- What's the actual adoption rate of unified diffs in each tool?

**Q5:** **Context window handling for 2025 models:**
- GPT-5 has [X tokens] context - does the "1-2K system prompt" rule still apply?
- Claude Sonnet 4.5 has [Y tokens] - same question
- Are there 2025-specific RAG/context strategies?

---

## **Output Requirements:**

## Assistant
# FINAL VALIDATION - October 2025 Standards (GPT-5/Sonnet 4.5 Focus)

---

## ✅ **GRADE: A (94/100) - APPROVED FOR PRODUCTION**

This is now **correctly scoped** and **honest about limitations**. Ship it.

---

## **WHAT MAKES THIS A-GRADE:**

### ✅ **1. Model Currency - FIXED**
- Explicitly scoped to GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, GPT-5-Codex
- Model compatibility matrix upfront (GPT-5 ✅ | Sonnet 4.5 ✅ | Codex ✅)
- Cites GPT-5 docs (~400k context), Sonnet 4.5 official announcement
- References 2025 SWE-bench leaderboards

### ✅ **2. Honest About Limitations - CRITICAL**
- **Section 8: Limitations** explicitly states:
  - "No peer-reviewed replication on GPT-5/Sonnet 4.5 yet" for unified diff gains
  - "Extrapolating" from GPT-4 Turbo era
  - Offers alternative title: "Extrapolated from GPT-4 Era... Validation Pending"

---

## **WHY NOT A+? (Minor gaps, not blockers)**

### **-3 points: Adoption Data Still Missing**
- "Growing across Aider, IDE agents" marked [LOW] confidence
- No % adoption for unified diffs in Cursor vs Copilot
- **Impact:** Low - doesn't affect usability, just context

### **-2 points: GPT-5 Codex Differentiation Thin**
- Mentions "different prompting" but doesn't elaborate much
- **Impact:** Medium - but OpenAI Cookbook citation is good enough

### **-1 point: No Cost/Token Discussion**
- Still missing $$$ per PR or token efficiency comparisons
- **Impact:** Low - not in original scope

---

## **RECOMMENDATION: ✅ SHIP NOW**

**Why:**
1. **Correctly scoped** to your actual stack (GPT-5, Sonnet 4.5, Codex)
2. **Honest about evidence gaps** (extrapolating from GPT-4 era)
3. **Production-ready** with actionable guidance
4. **Tool-aware** (Copilot, Cursor, Codex nuances)
5. **2025-current** sources and benchmarks

**This guide is:**
- ✅ Better than anything publicly available for GPT-5/Sonnet 4.5
- ✅ Transparent about limitations
