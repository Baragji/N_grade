Perfect analysis -> 1. I need you to maintain the role of ceo/lead dev/validator -> so your only puporse from here on, will be to produce best practice instructions/prompts so ai can executre 2. Here are two docs, I need you to asses wich one is the better to use as a tempalte for creating instructions 3. after that we will tailor the chosen one to the next steps @ai-coding-prompt-guide.md @planner_ai_minimal_guide.md

Recommendation

Choose docs/Agentic_prompt_guide/planner_ai_minimal_guide.md as the template.
Rationale: It is a concise, stateless Planner guide with a built-in plan gate, diff-only editing, explicit gates, commit hygiene, and security rules that map cleanly to our dual‑agent flow and non‑technical verification needs.
Kernel rules match our workflow: docs/Agentic_prompt_guide/planner_ai_minimal_guide.md:8
Planner → Executor JSON hand‑off enables clear, verifiable tasks: docs/Agentic_prompt_guide/planner_ai_minimal_guide.md:33, docs/Agentic_prompt_guide/planner_ai_minimal_guide.md:36
Plan-first and patch-only instructions are explicit: docs/Agentic_prompt_guide/planner_ai_minimal_guide.md:60, docs/Agentic_prompt_guide/planner_ai_minimal_guide.md:69
Drop‑in system and task prompts are ready-to-use: docs/Agentic_prompt_guide/planner_ai_minimal_guide.md:83, docs/Agentic_prompt_guide/planner_ai_minimal_guide.md:91
Token efficiency guidance preserves budget: docs/Agentic_prompt_guide/planner_ai_minimal_guide.md:117
What to Borrow From the Other Guide

Security/enterprise checklist (fold into our final planner prompts):
OWASP LLM, Secret Scanning/Protection, pin Actions by SHA, OpenSSF Scorecard: docs/Agentic_prompt_guide/ai-coding-prompt-guide.md:137
Production-ready deliverables checklist (enforce as DoD):
Unified diff, tests pass with logs excerpt, lint/format clean, PR rationale, Conventional Commit: docs/Agentic_prompt_guide/ai-coding-prompt-guide.md:46
Troubleshooting phrasing for patch apply, loops, hallucinations:
docs/Agentic_prompt_guide/ai-coding-prompt-guide.md:60
Optional: the starter “Implementation Agent” prompt can inform the Executor’s side (not the Planner): docs/Agentic_prompt_guide/ai-coding-prompt-guide.md:111
Fit to Our Constraints

AI-driven delivery: Planner guide is stateless and minimal, reducing drift and toolside variability.
Non-technical stakeholder: The hand‑off JSON + STATUS/LOGS requirements produce artifacts that are easy to verify without coding.
Verifiable outcomes: The plan gate + diff-only + tests/lint/build gates guarantee an audit‑ready trail, aligning with evidence-first repo practices.
Enterprise-grade: Security/CI guardrails are explicit; we will adopt the stronger compliance bullets from the other guide.
Proceeding Plan (Tailoring Next)

Add repo-aligned DoD and gates to the Planner templates:
Tests: pytest -q
Mutation: make mutation (report at reports/mutation/*)
Accessibility: pnpm run axe-ci (reports at reports/accessibility/*)
OWASP LLM: python scripts/owasp_llm_gate.py (reports at reports/owasp-report.*)
Evidence visibility for the human:
Require “STATUS: GREEN” and a short logs excerpt in output.
List artifact paths produced (summary format acceptable), especially under reports/* and, if using dual-agent flows, under runs/<run-id>/artifacts/*.
Dual‑agent alignment:
Respect plan gate and hand‑off JSON; incorporate run_id semantics from our dual‑agent prompts when applicable (executor/validator separation).
Security & compliance:
Merge the Security block and Deliverables checklist from the other guide into the Planner’s “Kernel Rules” and DoD.
Repo-Ready Draft (to tailor)

System Prompt (Planner)
Emit minimal, actionable instructions only.
Rules: plan‑then‑patch; unified diff only; run tests/lint/build gates; minimal touch; Conventional Commits; never print secrets; keep context targeted; produce STATUS/LOGS and list of artifact paths on success.
Task Payload (Planner → Executor)
Keep the JSON schema as in planner_ai_minimal_guide.md:36 and set deliverable to unified_diff_only.
Include repo commands in context.standards: pytest -q, make mutation, pnpm run axe-ci, python scripts/owasp_llm_gate.py.
First Output
PLAN (≤5 bullets) then wait for approval.
On Approval
Return only a valid unified diff; run gates; output:
STATUS: GREEN or the failing gate
LOGS: short excerpt
PR_NOTE: what/why/risks (≤120 words), Conventional Commit title
ARTIFACTS: list of produced report paths
If you confirm, I’ll produce the tailored Planner “System Prompt” and “Task Prompt” with the repo’s exact commands and artifact paths baked in, plus a short checklist the human can use to verify outputs without coding.

Tailored Planner Prompts

Selected template: docs/Agentic_prompt_guide/planner_ai_minimal_guide.md
Why: Minimal, stateless, plan-gate first, diff-only edits, explicit CI gates, and security rules — ideal for AI-led delivery and non-technical verification.
System Prompt (Planner)

You are a stateless Planner for coding agents.
Emit minimal, actionable instructions only.
Rules:
Plan-then-patch flow: Task → Context → Constraints/DoD → PLAN (≤5 bullets; wait) → unified diff patch → run gates → PR note.
Unified diff only for edits (---/+++ headers, @@ hunks). No prose with the patch.
Gates (run and report):
Tests: pytest -q
Lint: make lint
Mutation: make mutation (artifacts under reports/mutation/*)
Accessibility: pnpm run axe-ci (artifacts under reports/accessibility/*)
OWASP LLM: python scripts/owasp_llm_gate.py --report-json reports/owasp-report.json --report-html reports/owasp-report.html
Touch limits: edit only referenced paths; no stray files/folders; smallest viable diff.
Security & compliance: never print secrets; pin GitHub Actions by SHA; new deps must pass OpenSSF Scorecard; follow OWASP LLM Top-10.
Commit hygiene: Conventional Commits for title/body.
Context discipline: include only files/docs needed for the task; do not paste whole repos.
Output only the required sections.
Task Prompt (fill-in)

TASK: <short imperative>
CONTEXT:
paths: <files to touch>
standards: pytest -q, make lint, make mutation, pnpm run axe-ci, python scripts/owasp_llm_gate.py
notes: <interfaces/contracts or constraints>
DOD:
Tests updated/added and all pass
Lint/format clean
Mutation, Accessibility, and OWASP reports generated; review key findings
Unified diff only; minimal surface; no stray files
PR note (what/why/risks, ≤120 words); Conventional Commit title
FIRST OUTPUT: PLAN (≤5 bullets) then WAIT for approval.
ON APPROVAL: return unified diff only; run gates; print STATUS/LOGS/PR_NOTE/ARTIFACTS.
Planner → Executor Payload (JSON)

Use this minimal schema per task:
{
"task_title": "Brief imperative",
"goal": "One-sentence outcome",
"context": {
"paths": ["autonomy/steps.py", "tests/test_execute_tool_step.py"],
"standards": ["pytest -q", "make lint", "make mutation", "pnpm run axe-ci", "python scripts/owasp_llm_gate.py"],
"notes": ["call out any API contracts or repo constraints here"]
},
"definition_of_done": [
"New/updated tests cover the change; all tests pass",
"Lint/format clean; mutation/accessibility/OWASP artifacts produced",
"Unified diff only; minimal surface; no stray files",
"PR note explains what/why/risks (≤120 words), Conventional Commit title"
],
"plan_gate": true,
"deliverable": "unified_diff_only"
}
Executor Output Contract

After approval:
PATCH: a single valid unified diff, no prose.
GATES: run pytest -q, make lint, make mutation, pnpm run axe-ci, OWASP LLM command.
OUTPUT:
STATUS: GREEN | or failing gate name
LOGS: short excerpt showing pass/fail
PR_NOTE: what/why/risks; Conventional Commit title
ARTIFACTS: list paths produced (e.g., reports/mutation/summary.json, reports/accessibility/summary.json, reports/owasp-report.json, reports/owasp-report.html)
Human Verification Checklist (no code skills needed)

Open reports/mutation/summary.json: confirm score meets target or note gaps.
Open reports/accessibility/summary.json: confirm violations are 0 or listed with remediation notes.
Open reports/owasp-report.html: confirm no critical findings.
Confirm tests pass message in LOGS and no lint errors reported.
Confirm the PR_NOTE explains what changed, why, and risks in ≤120 words.
Confirm only referenced files changed and diff is minimal.
Would you like me to apply these tailored sections into docs/Agentic_prompt_guide/planner_ai_minimal_guide.md as a new “Repo Tailoring” block, or keep them as a separate planner prompt file?

## User
1. You asked: "Should we maintain these as a separate planner prompt file?"
2. I've prepared [System_prompt_planner.md](docs/Agentic_prompt_guide/System_prompt_planner.md) (docs/Agentic_prompt_guide/System_prompt_planner.md) as an empty template for you - please develop a comprehensive, self-contained planner system prompt within this file.
3. This approach represents industry best practices for prompt organization and management.

## Agentic Assistant
Added the comprehensive, repo-tailored Planner system prompt.

File: docs/Agentic_prompt_guide/System_prompt_planner.md
Contents:
System prompt with plan-then-patch flow, diff-only edits, CI gates, security posture, and evidence protocol.
Repo-specific gates: pytest, lint, mutation, accessibility (axe-ci), OWASP LLM.
Planner→Executor JSON task payload schema.
Output protocol (PLAN gate → PATCH → RUN_GATES → RESULT with STATUS/LOGS/PR_NOTE/ARTIFACTS).
Failure handling, forbidden behaviors, token budget, and style guidance.
Starter templates for quick use.
Want me to align executor/validator prompts to reference this new Planner file, or keep them as-is?
