# Executor Systems — Documentation Suite

This suite defines how we build, test, and ship any generated application reliably (e.g., a sleep tracker). It focuses on the Executor’s systems rather than specific implementations.

## Documents
- Technical Specifications: `technical_spec.md`
- Development Framework: `development_framework.md`
- Quality Assurance Process: `qa_process.md`
- Asset Management System: `asset_management.md`
- Error Prevention Mechanisms: `error_prevention.md`

## How to Use
1. Start with `technical_spec.md` to capture requirements and acceptance criteria.
2. Follow `development_framework.md` for coding standards, branching, and tests.
3. Organize assets per `asset_management.md` to keep design/docs/templates clean.
4. Run PR reviews and CI per `qa_process.md`.
5. Apply the checklists in `error_prevention.md` before merging and release.
