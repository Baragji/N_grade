# Autonomous AI Coding System Phase 0 Strategic Charter

## Problem Statement
- The organization lacks a production-grade foundation for the autonomous AI coding system envisioned in the autonomous_ai_roadmap_v2.md, leaving governance, infrastructure, and validation capabilities immature.
- Stakeholders require evidence-backed confidence that Phase 0 will de-risk subsequent investments across Phase 0 through Phase 8, including compliance with the EU AI Act, ISO 42001, and GDPR from day one.
- The absence of codified repository structure, branch protection, and continuous validation has created fragmented workflows where teams reference Phase 0 and Phase 1 goals inconsistently, causing delivery slippage across the 26-week program.
- Without aligned charter objectives, the €250,000 programme budget risks misallocation across Phase 0, Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3, Phase 4, Phase 5, Phase 6, Phase 7, and Phase 8 deliverables, undermining the monthly €41,700 burn projection.
- Our current onboarding experience lacks deterministic environment setup, making it difficult to validate health across Dockerized services (app, postgres, redis, meilisearch) and leading to gate failures prior to Phase 0 acceptance.
- Evidence artifacts are scattered across ad hoc folders, preventing automated verification for G0 and jeopardizing readiness for later gate reviews covering Phase 3 to Phase 8.
- Steering committees have not ratified risk mitigation strategies for regulatory, security, and financial controls, leaving the board without confidence to approve the Phase 0 exit criteria.

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Repository structure implements 40+ canonical directories with README.md stubs aligned to evidence/ and state/ specifications, audited through scripts/bootstrap_repo.sh and validated before Phase 0 exit.
- ✅ CI/CD workflows for build, lint, tests, and gate validation run on every push, guaranteeing deterministic enforcement before Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 kickoffs.
- ✅ Docker services (application, postgres, redis, meilisearch) include healthchecks, environment parity with .env.example, and documented recovery steps to support transitions between Phase 0 and Phase 1.
- ✅ Branch protection policy requires reviews, signed commits, and status checks, preventing regressions that could cascade into Phase 4 and Phase 5 milestones.
- ✅ Evidence artifacts for approvals, gate validation, and environment baselines are generated and stored under evidence/, forming the compliance backbone for EU AI Act audits.
- ✅ Budget tracking dashboards confirm €250,000 total allocation and €41,700 monthly run-rate, aligning with Phase 6 and Phase 7 financial governance expectations.
- ✅ Regulatory controls referencing ISO 42001, EU AI Act, and GDPR are embedded within documentation, ensuring readiness for Phase 8 go-live certifications.

## Budget Ceiling
- The programme budget is capped at €250,000 across the 26-week initiative, with governance ensuring Phase 0 consumes no more than €41,700 to protect downstream investments.
- Cost allocation aligns with charter.yaml `budget_eur: 250000`, providing transparent linkage between human capital, tooling, and evidence production.
- Financial guardrails include monthly checkpoints tied to Phase 0 through Phase 8 steering reviews, with the finance lead validating €41,700 monthly burn assumptions.
- Vendor spend for infrastructure, compliance tooling, and automation remains within €12,000 for Phase 0, ensuring sufficient runway for Phase 1 platform buildout.
- Contingency reserves amounting to €15,000 remain untouched unless risk thresholds defined in the Primary Risks and Mitigations section are triggered.

## Regulatory Obligations
- Compliance with the EU AI Act is operationalized through documented evidence trails, data governance standards, and periodic audits baked into CI/CD workflows.
- ISO 42001 alignment mandates information security management across all environments, requiring encryption, role-based access, and continuous monitoring.
- GDPR obligations cover data minimization, consent management, and lawful processing, with controls documented in docs/development/environment_setup.md.
- Regulatory checkpoints occur at the end of Phase 0, Phase 1, Phase 3, Phase 5, and Phase 8, ensuring iterative validation and board visibility.
- Compliance working group maintains a risk register referencing EU AI Act, ISO 42001, and GDPR, with mitigation owners assigned in raci_phase0.csv.
- All documentation avoids sensitive production data, aligning with GDPR privacy principles and establishing a baseline for Phase 4 data handling.
- Evidence of regulatory adherence is captured under evidence/gates/g0_foundation.json and evidence/approvals/phase0_charter.json for auditor review.

## Primary Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk:** Misalignment between charter.md and charter.yaml budgets leading to funding disputes in Phase 2.
  - **Mitigation:** Automated cross-file validation ensures €250,000 is declared consistently, with finance sign-off stored in evidence/approvals/phase0_charter.json.
- **Risk:** Insufficient stakeholder engagement across the 9 phases causing rework in Phase 3 and Phase 4.
  - **Mitigation:** Weekly steering cadence documented in charter.yaml with RACIs ensuring accountable owners for Phase 0 through Phase 8.
- **Risk:** Non-compliance with EU AI Act obligations triggering remediation costs during Phase 5 security audits.
  - **Mitigation:** Embed compliance checks in ci.yml, security.yml, and gate_validation.yml, referencing EU AI Act, ISO 42001, and GDPR requirements.
- **Risk:** Infrastructure drift causing Docker environment failure prior to Phase 1 launch.
  - **Mitigation:** scripts/install_dev_tools.sh standardizes dependencies while docker-compose.yml includes healthchecks and restart policies.
- **Risk:** Evidence artifacts missing or corrupted, preventing gate acceptance and delaying Phase 6.
  - **Mitigation:** scripts/validate_structure.py verifies evidence paths, while evidence/gates/g0_foundation.json records validation results.
- **Risk:** Branch protection gaps allowing unreviewed merges into main during Phase 0 hardening.
  - **Mitigation:** docs/governance/branch_protection.md defines enforcement policies, ensuring approvals, checks, and signed commits are mandatory.
- **Risk:** Budget overrun due to scope creep in Phase 0 tasks.
  - **Mitigation:** Finance reviews monthly €41,700 burn, with change control requiring approval from charter stakeholders before reallocating funds to Phase 7 or Phase 8.
