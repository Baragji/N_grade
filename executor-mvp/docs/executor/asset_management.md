# Asset Management System

Organize assets and references to accelerate development.

## Repositories & Structure
- Design: `assets/design/` — Figma/Sketch exports, PNG/SVG snapshots.
- Documentation: `docs/` — specs, ADRs, API references.
- Templates: `templates/` — code boilerplates and snippets.
- Generated Output: `output/` — generated projects.

## Design Assets
- Store links to Figma/Sketch; export critical frames to versioned snapshots.
- Include interaction notes and accessibility annotations.

## Documentation
- Keep specifications up to date; cross-link to APIs and schemas.
- Add Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for significant choices.

## Code Templates & Boilerplates
- Node service skeleton (Express + TypeScript + Prisma + Zod).
- Frontend skeleton (React + Vite + testing).
- CI workflow snippets (unit/integration/E2E, artifact upload).
- Usage: copy templates into new projects; customize per spec.
