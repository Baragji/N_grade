* 4 files (`NOW.md`, `NEXT.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, plus a machine snapshot JSON)
* A **mandatory startup ritual** that *reads state before acting* (“say it aloud”)
* A **tiny validator** (start with Bash), with **future-proof fields** in JSON for later checkpointing/metrics

That gives you a clean path to production because it’s the same shape used by agent graphs with checkpoint resume (e.g., LangGraph “time-travel”/checkpointers) and by observability stacks using OpenTelemetry’s Gen-AI semantic conventions. ([langchain-ai.github.io][1])

Here’s the “ship-today” pack:

---

# 1) `docs/state_management/SESSION_PROTOCOL.md` (mandatory ritual with “say it aloud”)

```markdown
# Session Protocol (REQUIRED)

> The assistant MUST complete this protocol *before* any change.

## STARTUP (≈60s)
- [ ] Load `docs/state_management/NOW.md` → **STATE ALOUD:** current **Status**, **Branch**, **Active Work**
- [ ] Load `docs/state_management/NEXT.md` → **STATE ALOUD:** the **Must** task you will execute + its **DoD**
- [ ] Load latest `docs/state_management/session/*.json` → **STATE ALOUD:** last **commit**, **time_min**, **tokens.in/out**
- [ ] Verify env: `npm run typecheck && npm run lint` → **STATE RESULTS**
- [ ] If UI relevant: confirm servers 3000 / 3001 / 5173
- [ ] **Declare intent:** “I will execute **[TASK]** with **DoD:** [CRITERIA]. Proceeding.”

## WORK (15–20 min)
- Execute the single **Must** to its **DoD**.
- After each logical change: `npm run typecheck && npm run lint`.

## END (≈3 min)
- [ ] Verify: `npm run typecheck && npm run build` (+ preview if UI)
- [ ] Update `docs/state_management/NOW.md` (Status/health/Active Work)
- [ ] Append `docs/state_management/DECISIONS.md` (Changed / Why / Verified)
- [ ] Write `docs/state_management/session/YYYY-MM-DD.json` (state snapshot)
- [ ] Update `docs/state_management/NEXT.md` (completed → archive/reprioritize)
```

# 2) `docs/state_management/NOW.md` (starter)

```markdown
# Right Now
**Status:** Ready  
**Branch:** main  
**Health:** typecheck ✓ | lint ✓ | build ✓  
**Servers:** 3000 ✓ | 3001 ✓ | 5173 ✓

## Active Work
- Must: <task> (DoD: …)
- Should: <task> (optional)

## Blockers
(none)
```

---

# 3) `docs/state_management/NEXT.md` (starter)

```markdown
# Next Up (≤3 items)
1) **Must:** <task>  
   **DoD:** <measurable acceptance>  
2) **Should:** <task>  
   **DoD:** <measurable acceptance>  
3) **Could:** <task> (optional)
```

---

# 4) `docs/state_management/DECISIONS.md` (starter)

```markdown
# Decisions Log (append-only)

## 2025-09-30 — Session N
**Changed:** file1.ts, file2.tsx  
**Why:** <brief rationale>  
**Verified:** `typecheck ✓` `lint ✓` `build ✓` preview http://localhost:3000
```

---

# 5) `docs/state_management/session/2025-09-30.json` (snapshot template with future-proof fields)

```json
{
  "repo": "your/repo",
  "branch": "main",
  "commit": "abc1234",
  "checks": { "typecheck": true, "lint": true, "build": true },
  "tokens": { "in": 0, "out": 0 },
  "time_min": 0,
  "artifacts": [],
  "last_preview": "",
  "next_steps": [
    { "id": "example-task-id", "dod": "typecheck+lint+build ✓, visible behavior verified" }
  ],
  "risks": [],
  "otel_span_id": null,
  "graph_checkpoint_id": null
}
```

Why these extra fields?

* `graph_checkpoint_id` lets you later bind this file to a LangGraph checkpoint to **resume/time-travel** a run without reshaping your state. ([langchain-ai.github.io][1])
* `otel_span_id` is a no-op today, but when you add OpenTelemetry’s **Gen-AI semconv** you can correlate token/latency/cost without refactors. ([OpenTelemetry][2])

---

# 6) `scripts/check-state.sh` (tiny validator; run at startup)

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
[ -f docs/state_management/NOW.md ] || { echo "Missing docs/state_management/NOW.md"; exit 1; }
[ -f docs/state_management/NEXT.md ] || { echo "Missing docs/state_management/NEXT.md"; exit 1; }
[ -f docs/state_management/DECISIONS.md ] || { echo "Missing docs/state_management/DECISIONS.md"; exit 1; }
[ -d docs/state_management/session ] || { echo "Missing docs/state_management/session"; exit 1; }
latest="$(ls -1 docs/state_management/session/*.json 2>/dev/null | tail -n 1 || true)"
[ -n "$latest" ] || { echo "No session JSON found in docs/state_management/session"; exit 1; }
echo "STATE OK: $latest"
```

Then prepend it where it matters (dev task, or your AI runner):

```bash
bash scripts/check-state.sh && echo "Startup protocol satisfied."
```

---

## What to do next (today, ~30–45 min)

1. **Create the files** above in your repo (exact paths).
2. **Run a real session** strictly following `SESSION_PROTOCOL.md`.
3. **At session end**: update the three docs and write the JSON snapshot.
4. **Confirm the loop works:** cold start → read files → “say it aloud” → execute Must → verify → handoff updated.

> If the assistant cannot resume from a cold start using only these files, we iterate on the protocol (not infrastructure).

---

## Evidence for the long-term path (why this scales without rewrites)

* **Checkpointed resume / time-travel:** LangGraph documents first-class “time travel” from prior **checkpoints**; resuming creates a new branch in history. Your `graph_checkpoint_id` is the seam to bind sessions to those checkpoints later. ([langchain-ai.github.io][1])
* **Gen-AI telemetry standardization:** OpenTelemetry has official **Generative-AI semantic conventions** and a reference instrumentation effort to capture **tokens/latency/cost/metadata** as spans/metrics/events; your `otel_span_id` lets you correlate future traces to session snapshots. ([OpenTelemetry][2])
* **Risk/decision hygiene (when you ship):** If/when decisions become architectural, use lightweight ADRs (industry-standard practice) — keep most choices in `DECISIONS.md`, carve out ADRs only for significant, durable decisions. ([Architectural Decision Records][3])
* **Regulatory timing (EU AI Act) — for later, not today:** GPAI obligations **apply from Aug 2, 2025** (no Commission delay), with additional timelines for legacy models and high-risk categories. Keep this in mind when you turn internal tools outward; no need to act today. ([Digital Strategy][4])

---

## TL;DR

Yes, we’re on the same page. **Ship the 4 files + ritual + bash validator today.**
You’ll fix the memory issue now and keep a **clean seam** for checkpoint resume and telemetry later—without re-architecting.
